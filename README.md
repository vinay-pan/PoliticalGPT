# PoliticalGPT

In this project, I want to fine tune existing language models to create politically biased models. I want to train two models based on articles from CNN and Fox News that reference Trump, Biden, and Obama, mostly from the period 2015-2024. I think it would be really interesting to see an actually language model that has the exact biases that these media sources have (or don't have)!
